# Real Time Bus Tracker

The exercise demonstrates the ability to integrate the open-source platform Mapbox onto a webpage and how to add markers via a timer. The exercise also demonstrates the ability to use an API from MBTA to fetch real time locations for a specific bus line.

## How to Run

Download the project, then open index.html in browser to see the Mapbox integration with animation of the different stops. Open realtime.html in browser, then open up Developer Tools and view the Console to see the JSON output being fetched from the MTBA.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

From this starting point, I could see how both parts of this exercise could be combined and further explored to implement a map that shows the real time locations of a public transportation route where I live.
